## 🏗️ Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Integration
- **Sacred Simplicity Compatible** - All features respect the progressive disclosure framework
- **Stage-Aware Behavior** - Components adapt based on user's spiritual maturity level
- **Non-Intrusive Design** - Spiritual prompts enhance rather than interrupt the experience
- **Contextual Relevance** - All prompts and pauses relate to current audio content

### Progressive Disclosure Logic
```typescript
// Example: Volume control only appears after 3 minutes of listening
<AudioFeatureGate feature="volume_control">
  <VolumeControl ... />
</AudioFeatureGate>

// Sacred hint appears for locked features
<SacredAudioHint 
  featureKey="audio_analytics" 
  message="Audio analytics unlocked! See your growth through sacred sound."
/>
```

### Pause Engine Configuration
```typescript
// Adaptive configuration based on spiritual stage
const getDefaultConfig = (stage) => ({
  intervalMinutes: stage === 'seed' ? 10 : stage === 'growth' ? 8 : 
                   stage === 'maturity' ? 6 : 5,
  maxPausesPerSession: stage === 'seed' ? 2 : stage === 'growth' ? 3 : 
                       stage === 'maturity' ? 4 : 5,
  pauseDuration: stage === 'seed' ? 10 : stage === 'growth' ? 15 : 
                 stage === 'maturity' ? 20 : 25
});
```

### Build & Quality Metrics
- ✅ **TypeScript Compilation** - All type errors resolved
- ✅ **Build Success** - 31/31 pages generated successfully
- ✅ **ESLint Compliance** - Only non-blocking dependency warnings remain
