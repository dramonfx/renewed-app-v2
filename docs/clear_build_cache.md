# Build Cache Clearing Fix

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing a Next.js routing conflict error:
```
"You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path. Please check /(onboarding)/onboarding/page and /onboarding/page."
```

## Root Cause
This error was caused by stale build cache in the `.next` directory that contained conflicting route information from previous builds.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Cleared Build Cache**: Removed the `.next` directory completely to clear all stale build cache
2. **Rebuilt Application**: Ran `npm run build` to generate fresh build artifacts
3. **Verified Fix**: Confirmed the build completes successfully without routing conflicts

## Cache Clearing Process
```bash
# Remove the Next.js build cache directory
rm -rf .next

# Rebuild the application
npm run build
```

## Build Results
After clearing the cache, the build completed successfully with the following routes:

```

```

## Verification
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ No routing conflict messages
- ✅ All routes properly resolved
- ✅ Application ready for deployment

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Clear build cache when encountering routing conflicts
2. Consider adding `.next` to `.gitignore` if not already present
3. Include cache clearing in deployment scripts when needed
