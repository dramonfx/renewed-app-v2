# 🌿 RENEWED: The New Man Story – Strategic Experience Flow

Welcome to the official repository for **RENEWED: The New Man Story**, a spiritual transformation web application by At His Feet Productions. This project is built to guide users through a structured journey from a **natural mind** to a **spiritual mind**, based on the teachings of the book *Renewed: The New Man Story* and the **Mind Transformation Guide**.

## 🧭 Vision
This is not just an app. It is a **movement**:
- From confusion → clarity
- From fear → peace
- From doing → being
- From transactional life → fruit-bearing life

We are building a place where heaven meets earth—one mind at a time.

> "Set your mind on things above, not on earthly things." — Colossians 3:2
